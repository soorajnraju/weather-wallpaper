# Weather Wallpaper

A macOS app that turns your desktop wallpaper into a live 3D globe with real-time weather, flights, and more.

Built with MapboxGL, Swift, and WebKit. Entirely vibe-coded with Claude.

## Features

- **Day/Night Cycle** — real-time sun position with twilight and night overlays
- **Weather Radar** — live precipitation overlay via RainViewer (no API key needed)
- **Live Flights** — real-time aircraft positions from OpenSky Network
- **Pollen & Air Quality** — Google Pollen API + Open-Meteo air quality data
- **City Labels** — custom-styled country, state, city, and neighborhood labels
- **Globe Spin** — smooth auto-rotation (~40s per revolution)
- **Zoom Levels** — Globe, Country, City, and Street views
- **Search Location** — geocode any city/place and fly there
- **Menu Bar Controls** — toggle everything from the menu bar
